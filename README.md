### <ins>Overview</ins>

[Virtual Watch Party](https://virtual-watch-party.herokuapp.com/) is a 10-day, 2 person project, during Mod 3 of 4 for Turing School's Back End Engineering Program.

We created an application that consumes a movie database 3rd party API and allows users to login, add friends, search for movies, get a list of recommended movies, see details about each movie, and add their friends to `Virtual-Watch-Parties` which are "dates" to all watch the chosen movie at an agreed upon time.

- ‚≠ê Consume JSON APIs that require authentication
- ‚≠ê Build an application that requires basic authentication
- ‚≠ê Organize and refactor code to be more maintainable
- ‚≠ê Implement a self-referential relationship in ActiveRecord
- ‚≠ê Utilize Continuous Integration using Travis CI
- ‚≠ê Deploy to Heroku
- ‚≠ê Apply principles of flow control across multiple methods
- ‚≠ê Write migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys
- ‚≠ê Use Rails to create web pages that allow users to CRUD resources
- ‚≠ê Create instance and class methods on a Rails model that use ActiveRecord methods and helpers
- ‚≠ê Write model and feature tests that fully cover data logic and potential user behavior
- ‚≠ê Apply RuboCop‚Äôs style guide for code quality

# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

##### A note about friendships
###### The user story about adding friends states that if User A and User B are in the database and User A adds User B as a friend, then that friendship is confirmed, and User A can now invite User B to a Viewing Party. It does not explicitly state that User B must also add User A as a friend. Think of this like a Twitter ‚Äúfollow‚Äù relationship: if I follow you, I can invite you to a Viewing Party, but you can‚Äôt invite me to a party unless you follow me first.
